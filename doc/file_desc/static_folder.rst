The `static/` directory
==========================================

The static folder holds files which are not
dynamically altered by the **psiTurk** server (i.e., templated).  This
includes images, javascript libraries, CSS style
sheets etc...  
You can add additional files and folders for static files if you
need in your project.

It includes one top-level file (favicon.ico) which is the little
icon that appears next to the URL in the browser window.  You
might want to customize this with the favicon.ico file used by
your university or company.

In addition, there are typically four sub-directories:
