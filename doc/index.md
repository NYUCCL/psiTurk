# Welcome to psiturk

[`psiturk`](https://psiturk.org/)Â is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create high-quality behavioral experiments that are delivered over the Internet using a web browser.  

`psiturk` is not, _by itself_, used for creating surveys or interfaces in the browser (for that we recommend tools like [jspych](https://www.jspsych.org) or [d3.js](https://d3js.org)).  Instead, `psiturk` solves the _other_ myriad of problems that come up in web experimentation including:
- Reliably and securely serving webpages to participants over the internet
- Blocking repeat participation (when desired)
- Counterbalancing conditions
- Incrementally saving data to databases
- Simplifying the process of soliciting and approving work on crowdworking sites

`psiturk` is used in research fields ranging from cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, bioinformatics, marketing, computer security, user interface testing, computer science, and machine learning in both academia and industry.

Odds are pretty good that if you are thinking "should I start from scratch with Flask or node.js to implement my Mechanical Turk experiment"  the answer is no, use `psiturk` and save yourself a lot of time.

`psiturk` is built using an open source model that draws from the community to share best online experiment practices.  We happily accept bug reports, feature requests, and -- even better -- pull requests**ðŸŽˆ**!

## How to use our docs

The docs are broken up into several sections:

- **First Steps**: include our [Key Concepts](key_concepts.md) and [Get Started](getting_started.md) guide give a general overview to getting started with `psiturk`.

- **Topic guides**: give you background on specific aspects of `psiturk`. Make sure to check out the sections on [Example project walk-through](main_concepts.md) and [Deploying an app](deploy_streamlit_app.md), and [Customizing psiturk](develop_streamlit_components.md).

- **Tutorials**: provides high level overview of common project cases.  Make sure to check out the sections on the sample project walk-through and using jsPsych+`psiturk`.

- **Cookbook**: provides short code snippets and tips that might find useful.

- **Reference guides**: are the bread and butter of how our [APIs](api.md) and [configuration files](streamlit_configuration.md) work and will give you short, actionable explanations of specific functions and features.

- **Support**: gives you more options for when you're stuck or want to talk about an idea. Check out our discussion forum as well as a number of [troubleshooting guides](/troubleshooting/index.md).
