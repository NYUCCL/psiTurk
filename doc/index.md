# Welcome to psiturk

[`psiturk`](https://psiturk.org/)Â is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create high-quality behavioral experiments that are delivered over the Internet using a web browser.  

`psiturk` is not, _by itself_, used for creating surveys or interfaces in the browser (for that we recommend tools like [jspych](https://www.jspsych.org) or [d3.js](https://d3js.org)).  Instead, `psiturk` solves the _other_ myriad of problems that come up in web experimentation including:
- Reliably and securely serving webpages to participants over the internet
- Blocking repeat participation (when desired)
- Counterbalancing conditions
- Incrementally saving data to databases
- Simplifying the process of soliciting and approving work on crowdworking sites

`psiturk` is used in [many research fields](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=4685239787075608864) ranging from cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, bioinformatics, marketing, computer security, user interface testing, computer science, and machine learning in both academia and industry.

## How to use our docs

The docs are broken up into several sections:

- **First Steps**: include [What is psiturk?](what_is_psiturk) as an overview.  Then there is a quick-start guide in two main parts: [Getting started developing](getting_started) and [Collecting data](collecting_data).

- **Topic guides**: give you background on specific aspects of `psiturk` including how to [install](topic_guides/install), how to [record](topic_guides/recording) and [retrieve](topic_guides/retrieving) data, how to [set up a Mechanical Turk account](topic_guides/amt_setup), and how to use psiturk with other recruitment systems such as [in the lab](topic_guides/alternative_recruitment_channels).

- **Tutorials**: provides high level overview of specific tasks such as [using psiturk with jsPsych](tutorials/using-jspsych) or [automatically computing performance-based bonus payment amounts](auto-bonus).  Make sure to check out the sections on the [sample project walk-through](example-project-stroop).

- **Reference guides**: are the bread and butter of how our [APIs](reference/api) and [configuration files](reference/configuration-overview) work and will give you short, actionable explanations of specific functions and features.

- **Support**: gives you more options for when you're [stuck](support/getting_help) or want to talk about an idea with other people.
