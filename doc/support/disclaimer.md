psiturk is free, open source software provided to scientists
to aid in research. Because it helps you run paid experiments online
using crowdworking websites where you transfer money, errors in the software, 
or in your use of the software, can lead to **loss of money**. This is the very
nature of online research (errors may mean someone will actually
do your task and you need to pay them as a result).

Our belief is that these types of errors can be best limited
by having open, peer-reviewable software and sharing bug reports
between labs and research groups. In other words, even if you
wrote this software yourself it is possible that some bug could
cost you money when getting started.

   .. danger::
        **We take no responsibility for your use of the software**. We make
        no claims that it is entirely bug-free and any errors are not our
        responsibility. This is a community-run, community-supported
        system and not a company selling a product. We use
        the software in our lab and, when used correctly, has never caused
        us to lose money due to mistakes. However, it is
        **always possible to mis-use the software in a costly way.**
   ```

In addition, while we strive to keep the services and dependencies 
related to this project running and up-to-date, certain things can happen that, in 
the short-term, affect your ability to
collect data. Again, using the system you must understand what the
risks are. The good news is that because the system is open source
if there is a problem everyone can read the code themselves and make
suggestions on how to fix things.

Some suggestion to avoid costly mistakes from happening:  

1. Test your code a lot in the sandbox to make sure every stage is working and you understand what psiTurk is doing.

1. Run small batches at a time to verify everything is working 

1. Keep your payment account balance reasonably low at 
    any point in time. It is impossible to spend more money than 
    is in your account at any point in time.

1. Exit the psiturk server or shut down remote servers when you 
    are not using it to collect data. This ensures that no one will be able to actually perform your task and then claim they are owed payment. This also limits the ability of bots and other scammers to reverse engineer your task.  

1. When testing "live", explain in the text of your Ad that this 
    is a test and you are looking for feedback. Workers get frustrated when you put bad or broken experiments online, but are often very helpful if you explain that you are hoping to get feedback on an unfinished project.
