# Getting help

There are a number of ways to get help with psiTurk.

1. The [https://psiturk.org](https://psiturk.org>) has meta-information about
    the system.
1. Usage questions should go to the psiTurk Google Group [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/psiturk).
    Search for answers to common questions or post your own. Chances are if you
    run into a problem someone else will as well.
1. Potential bugs in the code, or feature requests, should be posted as a
    [github issue](https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk/issues)
    This is an open discussion of possible issues, bugs, feature requests, etc.
    Browse the open and closed issues first before posting.
    See the [guide for contributors](contributing-to-psiTurk)
    for more information about using the issues tracker.
1. `[Todd Gureckis](http://gureckislab.org/~gureckis)  taught a class covering
    online data collection and psiTurk at NYU Spring 2014. All lectures were
    videotaped and are available [here](http://gureckislab.org/courses/spring14/online_data_collection/)
1. Follow [@psiturk](https://twitter.com/psiturk) on Twitter for helpful
    tips and breaking news.
1. If all else fails and you feel you simply cannot get help, you can consider
    emailing [authors@psiturk.org](mailto:authors@psiturk.org), the benevolent
    dictators of the project and system architects. However, if you haven't
    first pursed the above options, you may not get a quick response.
