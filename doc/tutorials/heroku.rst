Running psiTurk on Heroku
=========================

`Heroku <https://www.heroku.com>`_ is a cloud service that lets you run
applications in the cloud. You can run `psiTurk` on `Heroku` by preparing a git
repository and then pushing it to `Heroku` which will deploy and autorun the
code for you.

The benefits of `Heroku` include the following:

- It's somewhat easier to manage than `Amazon Web Services EC2 <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/>`_
  for the tech-wary (no need for security groups, no need to ssh in).
- You can set up a free PostgreSQL server
  (which is :ref:`highly recommended <databases-overview>` to use over the
  default SQLite database that `psiTurk` uses). A database server is required on
  heroku as files, including `participants.db`, are ephemeral. Data would be
  lost every time the app spins down.
- You get free SSL for hosting your own ad.
- It's scalable.
- You get a `Heroku` buffering server in front of your `psiTurk` gunicorn
  instance, which helps with performance a little bit.

One downside with `Heroku` is that it can get expensive if you need any kind of
horsepower beyond 512MB memory and one node.

What follows is a step-by-step tutorial for setting up a `psiTurk` example
experiment on `Heroku` (both the experiment itself and ad) with a `PostgreSQL`
database for collecting data.

All commands listed in this tutorial are meant to be typed into your terminal application.

#.  Go to the `Heroku website <https://www.heroku.com>`_ and create a new account
    if you don't already have one.

#.  Make sure that :ref:`psiTurk <install>`,
    `git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_, and
    the `Heroku Command Line Interface <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli>`_
    are installed on your computer.

#.  * **If you don't already have a psiturk experiment:**

      Create a psiTurk example at a desired location ::

        psiturk-setup-example

      Navigate into your newly created psiTurk example folder::

          cd psiturk-example

    * **If you are starting from an already-existing psiturk project:**

      Navigate to your project root directory.

#.  **If your experiment is not already in a git repository:**
    Initialize a Git repository in the root dir of your psiturk project the
    psiTurk (your current working directory)::

      git init

#.  Log in to `Heroku`, entering your heroku credentials when promted for them::

      heroku login

#.  Create a new app on `Heroku`::

      heroku create

    .. note::
      Running this command will add a ``git remote`` to
      your ``.git/config`` file, which will make it so that any `heroku` commands
      run from your project folder will be run against your newly-created heroku app.

#.  Run the following psiturk shell command::

      psiturk-heroku-config

    Running this command copies all files from psiturk's `heroku_files folder <https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk/tree/master/psiturk/heroku_files>`_
    into your experiment's root directory. These are needed for your experiment to run on Heroku.

    This command also runs ``heroku config:set ON_CLOUD=1`` in your shell on your behalf.
    This sets an environment variable called ``ON_CLOUD`` to the value ``1`` in your heroku app's environment.
    Setting ``ON_CLOUD=1`` in your environment tells psiturk to use `some sensible defaults <sensible-cloud-defaults_>`_ for several config settings.
    Specifically, it sets defaults for ``host``, ``threads``, ``errorlog``, and ``accesslog``.

    .. _sensible-cloud-defaults: https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk/blob/master/psiturk/default_configs/cloud_config_defaults.txt

    .. warning::

      **Heads up!** The `sample config.txt file <sample-config-txt_>`_ generated by psiturk 3 shows defaults in your config.txt commented out
      (prepended with a ``;``). Cloud defaults will override any defaults that are commented-out in your config.txt.

      .. _sample-config-txt: https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk/blob/master/psiturk/example/config.txt.sample

      But if the cloud defaults are set in your config.txt then
      the cloud defaults will be overridden. To remedy this, you will need to either:

      1.  change them in your config.txt or re-comment them out, or
      2.  set environment variables on heroku for the corresponding cloud defaults that take precedence over your ``config.txt`` values.

         For the latter, any of the config settings can be overridden in the heroku environment
         by setting ``PSITURK_{uppercase_config_name}`` via ``heroku config:set``. For example, to override a config.txt ``threads``
         on heroku, one could run the following::

           heroku config:set PSITURK_THREADS=1

#.  Set a database that your heroku app will use.

    * **To get a free heroku-hosted postgresql database:**

      Create a Postgres database on the newly created `Heroku` app::

        heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql

      This will provision a psiturk-compatible postgresql database, and set an
      environment variable on your app called ``DATABASE_URL`` that points to your database.

      To see the ``DATABASE_URL`` given to you by heroku for this newly-provisioned postgresql database,
      you can run the following::

        heroku config

      .. important::
        This URL includes your username and password. Anyone who has access to the ``database_url`` can
        connect to your database and has access to the data stored in it!

    * **If you already have a publicly-accessible database hosted elsewhere:**

      Then you can do one of the following:

      1.  list its url as your ``database_url`` in your config.txt and be sure that ``DATABASE_URL`` is not set in your
          heroku environment (check ``heroku config``), or
      2.  set its url in your heroku environment (``heroku config:set DATABASE_URL=your-url``)

    .. important::
      psiTurk prefers environment variables over all other config file settings.
      Most environment settings need to prepend ``PSITURK_`` to the corresponding
      config setting name, with the exception of two environment variables:

      1. ``DATABASE_URL``
      2. ``PORT``

      These two, if present in the environment, are respected even if not prepended by ``PSITURK_``.

      This means that if ``DATABASE_URL`` is set in your heroku environment, it will override
      any setting you have in ``config.txt``.

#.  **Optional**: if you want to use the :ref:`psiturk dashboard <dashboard-overview>` from your heroku
    instance to run AWS some commands, or if you want your heroku instance to run any :ref:`tasks <tasks-overview>` created
    by the dashboard:

    * Set your AWS credentials as environment variables within your
      heroku app, replacing ``<XYZ>`` with your access and secret
      keys for :ref:`Amazon Web Services <amt-setup>`::

        heroku config:set aws_access_key_id=<XYZ>
        heroku config:set aws_secret_access_key=<XYZ>

#. Stage all the files in your psiTurk example to your Git repository: ::

    git add .

#. Commit all the staged files to your Git repository: ::

    git commit -m "Initial commit"

#. Push the code to your `Heroku` git remote, which will trigger a build process
   on Heroku, which, in turn, runs the command specified in `Procfile`, which
   autolaunches your `psiTurk` server on the Heroku platform::

    git push heroku master

   .. note::
    Any time you want to push changes to your heroku-hosted psiturk experiment,
    you will need to repeat the above flow of ``git add``, ``git commit``, ``git push``.

#. You can run through your heroku-hosted experiment by visiting your heroku app's url.

   To get your app's url, run ``heroku domains`` from the root of your local psiturk app,
   and visit your app's reported domain url in a browser. From that url, you can conveniently obtain a debugging url by clicking
   "Begin by viewing the `ad`."

#. To download data from your heroku app using a locally-run psiturk, set
   your local psiTurk app to use the same database that your experiment uses when
   it runs on heroku.

   To do so, get the ``DATABASE_URL``
   of your heroku psiturk instance by running ``heroku config``, and set the database url in any of the
   following local places:

   1. your ``config.txt`` file, or
   2. your own local environment.

   .. warning::

     If you opt to set your database url in your ``config.txt`` file, then be cautious
     about sharing your experiment code -- the url contains your database username and password!

   Once your local psiturk app uses the same database as your heroku app, then you can run the
   following to download your experiment data, regardless of whether you have run through
   your experiment hosted locally *or* on Heroku::

     psiturk download_datafiles

   This should generate three datafiles for you in your local directory:

   * ``trialdata.csv``,
   * ``questiondata.csv``, and
   * ``eventdata.csv``.

   Congratulations, you've now gathered data from an experiment running on `Heroku`!


   .. note::
     psiTurk will look for a file called ``.env`` in the root of your psiturk app and read in any
     KEY=VALUE settings in there as environment variables for your psiturk app. Therefore, one could put the
     following content in a file called ``.env`` to set the database_url::

       DATABASE_URL=url-for-your-publicy-accessible-database


#.  To post a hit to MTurk that uses your heroku app, set your local psiTurk config.txt's :ref:`ad_url <hit_configuration_ad_url>` settings to point to
    your heroku app. The easiest way to do this is to set :ref:`ad_url_domain <hit_configuration_ad_url_ad_url_domain>` in your config.txt's ``[HIT Configuration]`` section
    to equal your heroku domain name.

    For example, if running ``heroku domains`` reported that your heroku domain was ``example-app.herokuap.com``, then you would simply set
    ``ad_url_domain = example-app.herokuapp.com`` in your config.txt's ``[HIT Configuration]`` setting. With that, HITs posted to mturk should correctly point to your heroku app.


    .. seealso::
      See the :ref:`hit_configuration_ad_url` for more information.



From your *local* ``psiTurk`` session, you can now
`create and modify HITs <command_line/hit.html>`_. When these are accessed by
Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, the workers will be directed to the `psiTurk`
session running on your `Heroku` app. This means that it is never necessary to
launch `psiTurk` and run `server on` from *anywhere* to run an experiment on
Heroku. The server is automatically running, accessible via your Heroku domain
url. (Of course, if you want to debug locally, you can still run a local server.)

.. note::

  If you stay on the "Free" Heroku tier, your app will go to "sleep"
  after a period of inactivity. If your app has gone to sleep, it will take a
  few seconds before it responds if you visit its url. It should respond quickly
  once it "awakens". Consider upgrading to a "Hobby" heroku dyno to prevent your
  app from going to sleep.

.. note::

  If you want to run commands against your `postgresql` db, you can run
  `heroku pg:psql` to connect, from where you can issue postgres commands. You
  can also connect directly to your heroku postgres db by installing and running
  `postgresql` on your local machine, and passing the `DATABASE_URL` that your heroku app uses
  as a command-line option.
