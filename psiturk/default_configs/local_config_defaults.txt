# The psiturk (gunicorn) server can optionally serve traffic over https. This is
# normally not necessary if the psiturk server is set up behind a reverse proxy
# server, as is the default case with cloud hosting providers such as heroku.
#
# In reverse-proxy situations,
# the reverse proxy communicates with web browsers and other clients over https,
# while communicating on the backend with the gunicorn server over http. The
# psiturk server would only be listening on localhost and would not serve
# traffic directly.
#
# To have gunicorn use https, set both the `certfile` and `keyfile` below to point

# a participant be given to complete the task after starting? How long should the
# task last? This is different than the `duration` specified when running
# `hit create`, because a participant may not start the task immediately after
# accepting it, while the hit `duration` starts ticking as soon as the hit is
# accepted (some workers queue their accepted hits before starting it).
