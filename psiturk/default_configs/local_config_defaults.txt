# If both certfile and keyfile are present and readable, then 
# the psiturk gunicorn server will run with ssl. You will need 
# to execute the psiturk with privileges sufficient to read 
# the keyfile (typically root). If you run `psiturk` with sudo, 
# make sure to execute the full path to the desired psiturk instance in your (virtual) environment. 
# See `launch-sudo-psiturk` for an example.

# If you want to do this, you are responsible for obtaining 
# your own cert and key. It is not necessary to run the 
# psiturk server with ssl in order to use your own ad server.
# You can have a proxy server such as nginx in front of 
# psiturk/gunicorn which handles ssl connections.

# See http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/deploy.html

[Task Parameters]

[Shell Parameters]
launch_in_sandbox_mode = true

# If you want to host your own ad, you are responsible for obtaining 
# your own cert and key and for configuring your own proxy server in front
# of psiturk/gunicorn. It is not necessary to include the cert and key
# in the [Server Parameters] section above -- You can have a proxy server 
# such as nginx in front of psiturk/gunicorn which handles ssl connections.
# Although if you don't have your certs in both places, then traffic between
# your proxy server and psiturk/gunicorn will not be encrypted. Perhaps that
# doesn't matter to you though if you configure your proxy server to pass traffic
# to your gunicorn/psiturk server via localhost.

# See http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/deploy.html

use_psiturk_ad_server = true
ad_location = false # https://<host>:<port>/ad -- only used if `use_psiturk_ad_server` is false. Set to whatever you set up your proxy server to listen on.
