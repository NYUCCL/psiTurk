		<h1> Call for participants</h1>
		<p>The Cognition and Computation Lab at New York University (NYU) is
		looking for online participants for a brief experiment on how people
		learn. The experiment can be run right at your desk. The only
		requirements are that you are at least 18 years old and are a fluent
		English speaker.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you completely finish the experiment, you will be paid $1.00 and
		entered into a drawing for an additional $10 bonus.  We enforce the
		odds so that one out of every 10 people who completes the task will
		receive a $10 bonus.  The experiment can take as little as 10 minutes
		or as long as 45 minutes depending on how fast you learn.  Thus, <b>you
			could be paid up to $11 for only a few minutes of your time!</b>
		Most people finish in 10-30 minutes (although it could take a bit
		longer, depending on the individual).
		</p>
		<p>This task can only be completed once.  Thus, if you have already
		    completed this task before the system will not allow you to run again.  If this
		    looks familiar please release the hit so someone else can participate.</p>

		Otherwise, please click the "Accept Hit" button on the Amazon site above to begin the task.
